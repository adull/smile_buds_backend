# SMILE BUDDIES

This was a fun project, but I'm done paying for hosting for it, so here is the back-end of the project. Feel free to host this wherever, I don't care and don;t want to lose the project, but also don't want to host it.  I don't think you need an env file, looking at the code, but you might, so do a grep for process.env. If it's expecting some process.env files make an .env file, and then do an `npm run build`. Have fun.

`rip.sql` in the root dir is a mysqldump of the prod db as of 3/13/2020.
